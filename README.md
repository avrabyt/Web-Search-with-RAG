# Full-Stack AI-Powered Web Search Application with Tavily Search API

Full-stack application tutorial, where we build an AI-powered search application from the ground up. This project leverages the cutting-edge capabilities of the **Tavily Search API** for fast, accurate, and **RAG-optimized** AI-enhanced search results. Through this tutorial, we explore the integration of advanced AI models and techniques, including the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique and the Mistral model `mixtral-8x7b-32768` as the Large Language Model (LLM), running on the **Groq LPU** for unparalleled processing speed and efficiency.

## Features

- **Tavily Search API**: Utilize for fast and accurate AI-enhanced search results.
- **Mistral Model**: Leverage as the LLM, running on the **Groq LPU**.
- **LangChain Python Package**: Orchestrate AI stacks seamlessly.
- **Databutton Platform**: Facilitate development - Build with a Python FastAPI backend and a React.js frontend.

## Note
The app was developed using the Databutton platform - the Capability and UI Builder Agents avialble within the tool *generated all the code*.
The comprehensive walkthrough of building this application is detailed in the tutorial video. From setting up the project environment to integrating the Tavily Search API and deploying the full-stack application, every step is explained. This tutorial also includes a demonstration of the app's minimal architecture.
